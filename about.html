                <p>Heya, I'm Lon!</p>
                <p>I'm a 2D animator specializing in anime and action animation. I love to improve, I strive for excellency and to create 
                exciting animations, that brings a smile to peoples faces.</p>
                <p>I am currently attending The Animation Workshop in Denmark and will 
                graduate with a bachelor in Character Animation in 2026. I have experience freelancing from 2019-2023 as an illustrator and have now 
                pivoted to freelancing for animation. Next to indie projects, I had the honor of working on One Piece for Toei Animation and have been 
                working on several more, as of yet unannounced projects in the Anime Industry.</p>
                <p>I am excited to work with you!</p>
